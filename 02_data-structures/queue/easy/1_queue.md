### **What is a Queue?**

A **queue** is a **linear data structure** that follows the  **FIFO (First In, First Out) principle** . It is similar to a real-world queue, such as people waiting in line at a store— **the first person to join the queue is the first one to be served** .

### **FIFO Principle (First In, First Out)**

* **First element added → First element removed**
* New elements are added at the **rear (back)** of the queue.
* Elements are removed from the **front** of the queue.

### **Queue Operations**

1. **Enqueue (Push)** → Add an element to the rear.
2. **Dequeue (Pop)** → Remove an element from the front.
3. **Peek (Front)** → View the first element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty** → Check if the queue is empty.
