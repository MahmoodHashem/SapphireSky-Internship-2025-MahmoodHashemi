### **Queue vs. Stack: Understanding the Key Differences**

A **queue** and a **stack** are both linear data structures, but they differ in the way elements are added and removed.

---

### **1. Order of Operations**

* **Queue** follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
  * The first element added is the first one removed.
  * Example: A line at a movie theater—people leave in the order they arrive.
* **Stack** follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**
  * The last element added is the first one removed.
  * Example: A stack of plates—removing the topmost plate first.
